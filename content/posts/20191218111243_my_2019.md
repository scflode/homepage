End of 2018 my work life as a full time employee ended. I was not sure nor had planned what to do in 2019. The initial plan was just to take some time off and
reflect how to proceed.

Right after leaving the office for the time being last time I was eager in trying out new things on a technical level. In the second half I was
investgating new programming languages in order to make more complex domains
easier to grasp. I read a bit about Elixir, Elm and other functional languages.
A co-worker also supplied me with ideas and material as he also did some things
outside the PHP world we were working in.

At the same time a former colleague contacted me with an idea of starting a product. The idea sounded appealing. It was again a new domain, it was something
that might help other people living a more healthy life.

We discussed how we can make this maybe something bigger. My colleague was already experienced when it comes to building a startup. We went this way for
a couple of weeks with pitching the idea to VCs and checking the market. This
was the first big learning in 2019 for me. I looked into how VC funded companies
work, how shares are best established, about dilution, investment stages like
pre-seed, seed, series A - Z. Also were to found an entity and what all comes
with this. A very interesting and absolute new experience for me. I was never
a sort of business guy but now I had to look into that.

Besides the business part we also started implementing a prototype. Or two to be more concise. We needed a backoffice app and wanted to have mobile apps for the
users. As mentioned above I looked into functional programming and this was the
perfect project to start with it. For the backoffice application I decided to go
with Elixir as I had read already one book about it at that time and felt like
going with it. The mobile app was started with Flutter which was pre-1.0 at that
time but already pretty mature for what we needed to support.

After all it turned out that getting VC money with how we wanted to realize the idea was not too easy. After a couple of talks we decided to bootstrap the idea rather than taking in money at that point. The also meant the stress and pressure will not be that high.

At the same time I started helping out a friend in his company. It was mainly consulting and customizing for Atlassian products. There we came across the idea for a product which enables people to track times via Jira (and other 3rd party plugins like Tempo). The friend already had a working prototype he was using for the task to keep track of the companies health.

With this idea I started diving into the world of Javascript after quite some absent time from it. The application was decided to be implemented in Electron to have the advantage of cross platform building.

Javascript is very powerful but also the learning curve was weird. It's not that it's particularly hard but best practices do not seem to really exist (or there are multiple ones that do not necessarily work together). Also Electron is a bit special although it is basically creating webpages for Chrome. Sort of but not really. But this might be a story for a later post.

Then in August I started to help my old company getting a big release out of the door. It was a suprising change but also nice to see all the people again. As a consultant I helped to manage the way to a big 3rd party software upgrade. It turned out to be a fairly different experience as an external contractor for only two days a week onsite. Much more focussed work was possible as there was mainly this one thing I was assigned.

In autumn a former co-worker asked me if I might have time for a new software project starting in 2020. This was a pretty nice coincidence as I was wondering what will be the next steps. The project sounds challenging and interesting. Looking forward to 2020.

Over the whole year I read quite some books and watched talks about technology I found interesting and general life related topics.

Besides all this work and business related stuff I was also able to spend much more time with my family. I became coach of my son's soccer team and was also able to spend more time with my daughter and help my wife tackling the day-to-day challenges more.

There will be a couple of follow-up posts where I will collect information about the different projects and the learnings from it.
