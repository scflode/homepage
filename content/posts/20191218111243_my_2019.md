This post reflects what I was able to achive in terms of experience in 2019.

There were the following areas I was able to gain knowledge:

* entrepreneurship
* learning
* health

## Entrepreneurship

I learned a lot about the building blocks of a startup:

* angel investment
* VCs
* equity
* shares
* options

Besides that I wrote my first business plan (not the favorite thing I'd like to do). Also I gained more insights about building a bootstrapped self-employment.

## Learning

In terms of learning I was able to learn and improve:

* Elixir
* Dart
* Typescript
* modern Javascript (ES2015/ES6 and ES7)
* CSS3 (new features)

I was using the following frameworks:

* Phoenix (Elixir)
* Flutter (Dart)
* Electron (Javascript / Typescript)
* Webpack
* Tailwind CSS

I read the following books:

* Elixir in Action, second edition
* Metaprogramming Elixir
* Programming Phoenix
* Phoenix in Action
* Desiging Elixir applications with OTP
* Refactoring UI
* Elm in Action
* Rust in Action

Besides that I read about a lot of topics about the used frameworks (especially Dart / Flutter and Javascript / Typescript).

## Health

I was also able to learn a lot about healthy habits. This knowledge was gained by a former colleague, several blog posts, Youtube channels. I also read "Der Ern√§hrungkompass". As a result I was able to reduce meat consumption and improve my nutrition.

Besides that I was also able to spend more time with my family and in general reduce the stress significantly.

Also I had refreshed some former contacts which was very insightful and kept me socially connected.

This was my 2019 in a nutshell. Not too bad in hindsight.
