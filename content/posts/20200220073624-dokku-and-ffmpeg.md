[Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) is a small PaaS that acts Heroku like. Basically this means it supports [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) to provide the software your application needs to run. 

Normally you use buildpacks to provide the language features for your app. That might be PHP, Ruby etc.. Under the hood Dokku creates a Docker container to run the application.

If you now need additional software, i.e. binaries your application calls, these are usually not there as those binaries like ffmpeg are not installed by default.

In this case you can use an additional buildpack to the rescue. This will inject the binary into the application container on deploy.
