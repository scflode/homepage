Some projects / products I worked on:

## ottonova (2016 - 2018)

ottonova is the first fully digital health insurance in Germany. I joined the company quite early and was designing the overall structure of the IT system in use by the agents and the customers.

This contained integrating third party systems as well as development of highly customized features to help customers getting a great experience and for agents to ease serving the customer's needs.

Besides that the engagement required having a very good and profound knowledge of the German health insurance system as well as deep knowledge of data privacy and data security.

I also implemented a lot of the IT workflows regarding agile development cycles.

As the backend team lead I was further engaged improving the teams workflows while keeping up to the high quality standards.

## PAYMILL (2014 - 2016)

As a team lead of the post processing team I helped improving and developing workflows regarding clearance, invoicing and mitigation procedures for payment processes.

This meant having a great knowledge about how payments work (especially credit card ones), working with high accuracy and living up to highest standards regarding code clarity and correctness.
